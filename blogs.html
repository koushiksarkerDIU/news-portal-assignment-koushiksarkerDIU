            <h1>Qs: Why we used templete string</h1>
            <p>ES6's template strings is a new way to combine strings. We already have methods such as join(), concat()
                etc to combine strings but the template strings method is the most sophisticated because itâ€™s more
                readable, no backslash to escape quotes and no more messy plus operators.</p>
